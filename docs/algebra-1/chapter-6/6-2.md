# 6.2: Radicals and Rational Exponents
# Rational and Radical Exponent Rules

In algebra, rational and radical exponents play a *crucial* role in expanding our understanding of mathematical expressions.

Try and think before this chapter: what even is $4^{\frac{1}{3}}$? Does this even make sense?

These rules provide a framework for manipulating expressions involving fractional and radical exponents. Let's explore the key concepts and rules in this chapter:

## Rational Exponent Rules

Rational exponents are expressions where the exponent is a **fraction**. The fundamental rules governing rational exponents are as follows:

### 1. Power Rule for Rational Exponents

The **power rule for rational exponents** states that when a number is raised to a rational exponent, you can take the numerator as the exponent for the base and the denominator as the root:

$ a^{\frac{m}{n}} = \sqrt[n]{a^m} $

For example, $ 4^{\frac{3}{2}} = \sqrt{4^3} = \sqrt{64} = 8 $.

## Radical Exponent Rules

Radical exponents involve expressions with roots, where the exponent is written as a fraction with the denominator representing the root. The following rules govern radical exponents:

### 1. Product and Quotient Rules for Radical Exponents

The **product rule for radical exponents** allows you to combine radicals with the same index, and the **quotient rule for radical exponents** applies similarly to division:

$ \sqrt[n]{a} \times \sqrt[n]{b} = \sqrt[n]{ab} $

$ \frac{\sqrt[n]{a}}{\sqrt[n]{b}} = \sqrt[n]{\frac{a}{b}} $

For example, $ \sqrt[3]{2} \times \sqrt[3]{4} = \sqrt[3]{2 \times 4} = \sqrt[3]{8} = 2 $.

### 2. Power Rule for Radical Exponents

The **power rule for radical exponents** states that raising a radical expression to a power is equivalent to raising the radicand to that power and taking the root:

$ (\sqrt[n]{a})^m = \sqrt[n]{a^m} $

For example, $ (\sqrt{3})^2 = \sqrt{3^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3 $.

## Example Problems

Let's apply these rules to solve some example problems:

1. Simplify the expression: $ 16^{\frac{3}{4}} $.

2. Compute: $ \frac{5^{\frac{3}{2}}}{5^{\frac{1}{3}}} $.

3. Combine the radicals: $ \sqrt{18} \times \sqrt{32} $.

4. Evaluate: $ (\sqrt{5})^3 $.

By mastering the rules of rational and radical exponents and practicing with example problems, you'll gain confidence in manipulating expressions involving these types of exponents, paving the way for deeper exploration into algebraic concepts.
